# translator
This is a project I did for university. 
The task was to write a C-program that is able to translate a text based on a dictionary it takes as input.

Input: <dictionary>.wb
Output: translated text to stdout
  
There are two ways you can start this program. 
  1. `./loesung /testcases/<dictionary>.wb` (you can choose any of the example testcases in the folder or you can create an own dictionary (use the same format as in the example.wb files))
  2. `cat testcases/<input-file>.stdin | ./loesung testcases/<dictionary>.wb` 
  
  
  If you start the program the 1. way, than you can enter your own text you want to translate on the command line.
